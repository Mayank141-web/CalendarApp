# CalendarApp
This is the code of a calendar app I mad for my Computer Science IA in the IB. You can use this if you want, but I haven't figured out how to use it outside of my IDE or Code Editor yet. You can use this as much as you want, but if you want to use the code or parts of the code in another project of yours, at least give me some credit.
